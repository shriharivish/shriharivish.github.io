The static X-Rays can damage healthy cancer cells on the edge of tumor along with the cancerous cells due to the contraction and expansion of lungs. This can be addressed by using a dynamically adjustable X-Ray projection that uses the depth information during respirtation. The aim of this project was to create a respiratory monitoring system to detect the depth of lungs. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/acharaakshit/Tracking-of-Lung-cancer">Github</a>.
