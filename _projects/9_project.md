 <h4><b>Abstract</b></h4>
<p>
We developed an application to monitor real-time crowd counts at public and private establishments like
hospitals, banks, ATMs, pharmacies and stores. The crowd count was provided for locations within a 50-kilometer radius. Modules were added to provide the order pickup functionality. The solution consisted of a public-user facing application, a service-provider facing application and the backend that handled all the real time data seamlessly.
