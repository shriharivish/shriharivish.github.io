I am an Electronics Design Engineer working in the Maternal
and Infant Care business at GE HealthCare, Bangalore, India.
Currently pioneering electronic design, transducer optimization
and signal processing for next generation wireless fetal sensors.

My research interests broadly lie in reducing complexity of deep
learning systems without compromising the generalization
capabilities.

I also spent a summer developing <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rminizinc/index.html">
rminizinc</a>: an interface
to MiniZinc in R, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~larsko/">
Lars Kotthoff</a> , Mr. <a href="https://hwborchers.lima-city.de/"> Hans W. Borchers</a> and
Prof. <a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/guido-tack">Guido Tack</a>.

Prior to GE, I pursued B.E. in Electronics and Instrumentation from BITS Pilani. 
I did my Bachelor's thesis at TranslaTUM, TU Munich, Germany at 
Prof. <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/hayden-oliver">
Oliver Hayden's</a> lab for biomedical electronics, where I worked on developing
a cell/tissue culture incubator and integrated it with a benchtop pipetting to accelerate cancer research.

I also did two summer internships at GE Healthcare, working on real-time montioring applications
and fast MRI scans respectively.

In my spare time, I play sports (primarily Cricket and Football), listen to music and catch-up with my friends.
