I am an Electronics Design Engineer working for the <a href="https://www.gehealthcare.com/products/maternal-infant-care">
Maternal and Infant Care</a> business at General Electric HealthCare, Bangalore, India.
Currently pioneering electronic design, transducer optimization
and signal processing for next generation wireless fetal sensors.

My research interests broadly lie in the intersection of electronics,
sensing, materials and computing to solve critical healthcare problems
that are inclusive to underpriviledged markets.

Prior to GE, I pursued B.E. in Electronics and Instrumentation from BITS Pilani. 
I did my Bachelor's thesis at <a href="https://www.translatum.tum.de/en/translatum/home/">TranslaTUM</a>,
TU Munich, Germany at Prof. <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/hayden-oliver">
Oliver Hayden's</a> lab for biomedical electronics, where my research contributed to help accelerate cancer research.

I spent a summer developing a miniaturized low-cost biosensor at <a href="https://www.ceeri.res.in/">
CSIR-CEERI</a>, Chennai, India. Additionally, my enthusiasm for artificial intelligence has led me to
take up multiple projects that use AI to deliver tangible outcomes.

In my spare time, I compose music, play the guitar, trek and play sports (primarily Soccer and Basketball).
