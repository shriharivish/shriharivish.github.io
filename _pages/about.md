I am an Electronics Design Engineer working for the Maternal
and Infant Care business at GE HealthCare, Bangalore, India.
Currently pioneering electronic design, transducer optimization
and signal processing for next generation wireless fetal sensors.

My research interests broadly lie in reducing complexity of deep
learning systems without compromising the generalization
capabilities.

Prior to GE, I pursued B.E. in Electronics and Instrumentation from BITS Pilani. 
I did my Bachelor's thesis at <a href="https://www.translatum.tum.de/en/translatum/home/">TranslaTUM</a>,
TU Munich, Germany at Prof. <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/hayden-oliver">
Oliver Hayden's</a> lab for biomedical electronics, where I worked on developing
a cell/tissue culture incubator and integrated it with a benchtop pipetting to accelerate cancer research.

I also spent a summer developing a miniaturized low cost biosensor for arrhythmia detection
in resource constrained setting at <a href="https://www.ceeri.res.in/">CSIR-CEERI</a>, Chennai
advised by Dr. <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=cNxcKfUAAAAJ&hl=en/">
Bala Pesala</a> .

My interest in artificial intelligence has led me to take up multiple projects relating to the topic as well.

In my spare time, I compose music, play the guitar, trek and play sports (primarily Football and Basketball).
