I am an Electronics Design Engineer working for the <a href="https://www.gehealthcare.com/products/maternal-infant-care">
Maternal and Infant Care</a> business at General Electric HealthCare, Bangalore, India.
Currently pioneering electronic design, transducer optimization
and signal processing for next generation wireless fetal sensors.

My research interests broadly lie in the intersection of electronics,
sensing, materials and computing to solve critical healthcare problems
that are inclusive to underpriviledged markets.

Prior to GE, I earned a B.E. in Electronics and Instrumentation from BITS Pilani. 
I conducted my Bachelor's thesis research at <a href="https://www.translatum.tum.de/en/translatum/home/">TranslaTUM</a>,
TU Munich, Germany under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/hayden-oliver">
Oliver Hayden</a> at his lab for biomedical electronics, where my work helped accelerate cancer research and drug testing.

In my spare time, I compose music, play the guitar, trek and play sports (primarily Soccer and Basketball).
