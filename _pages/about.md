I am a Research Engineer working with the Industrial AI team
at GE Research, Bangalore, India. I am primarily working on 
developing NLP techniques for patient reports to aid in
timeline based patient journeys.

My research interests broadly lie in reducing complexity of deep
learning systems without compromising the generalization
capabilities.

I also spent a summer developing <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rminizinc/index.html">
rminizinc</a>: an interface
to MiniZinc in R, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.uwyo.edu/~larsko/">
Lars Kotthoff</a> , Mr. <a href="https://hwborchers.lima-city.de/"> Hans W. Borchers</a> and
Prof. <a href="https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/guido-tack">Guido Tack</a>.

Prior to GE, I pursued MSc. Mathematics from BITS Pilani. I did my Master's thesis
at TU Munich, advised by Prof. <a href="https://biomedical-big-data.de/authors/markus_list/">
Markus List</a>, where I worked on developing machine 
learning frameworks for benchmarking sequence based miRNA tools.

I also did two summer internships at GE Healthcare, working on real-time montioring applications
and fast MRI scans respectively.

In my spare time, I play sports (primarily Cricket and Football), listen to music and catch-up with my friends.
